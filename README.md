## To run this locally
- setup database details in the .env file *( use the .evn.example as a guide or just rename it to .env )*
	- make sure you create a database and replace the databese name ( laravel ) with your database or create a database called laravel
- install dependancies with `composer install` and then ` npm install`
- run a migration with `php artisan migrate`; this will create a table called `todos` and the required columns.
- start the local server with `php artisan serve` and `npm run dev`.
